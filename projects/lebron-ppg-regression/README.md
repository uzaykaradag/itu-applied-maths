# LeBron-James-PPG-Prediction
In this project I worked with two other friends to analyze and make predictions about LeBron James' future points per game stats.
This project was for my MAT143 (Linear Algebra) class therefore there is some advanced linear algebra methods in use. 
I built the least squares section in particular.
The project is in Turkish, it may be hard to understand for non-Turkish speakers.
