# Analysis of the Big Tech Stocks, Timeseries Forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM
In this project I performed EDA and forecasting on the price-time data of the Apple, Google, Meta and Amazon stocks. Not quite sucessful but was able to predict the trend of the stocks here and there. All work was unfortunately done with MATLAB since this was the term project for my MATLAB class.
